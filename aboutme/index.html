        <h3>Sam</h2>
        <p>I am currently attending BYUI in pursuit of my software engineering degree with a focus on AI and machine learning.
            My favorite thing about attending BYUI has been the people I have been able to interact with as well as the focus on the gospel
            in the lessons taught here.  
            In my spare time I enjoy photography, gaming with friends, and playing cello (though never off sheet music). I look forward to 
            continuing my education and learning more about the world of software engineering.</p>
